0	"I'm leaving the EU, now give me a good deal."  "Why should we?"  "Fuck, I hadn't thought that far ahead."
0	Brexit is a huge mistake, a way for the UK to cover up its disastrous voting record on putting total idiots into government.
0	A hot mess.
1	Current polls suggest the UK would prefer a hard brexit as opposed to staying in the EU. Did the EU give you a grant for your video? It's biased in many areas! The UK is being punished by the EU for the democratic decision of it's people.
1	Great result. UK has sacrificed itself to allow the other european nations to use the leave excuse as blackmail to change things into the union. Thanks UK, your sacrifice will not be forgotten.
0	Brexit sucks, I’m Australian and I got denied access to travel to the UK because they were trying to tighten up the boarders lol. Worst!!!
1	It says a lot about the government and parliment.. When they keep remain on a table when all of them were Elected on a manifesto to leave...
0	The point is not that it's impossible. The point is, that it's just a rather bad idea to do so because it has negative consequences because it creates a legal vaccum.
0	RIP Brexit.
1	No deal is the best deal. Bollocks to Sky news , they are just EU sympathisers.
0	Literally the thing that people voted Brexit for, is something the EU already does.
1	The EU is a disgraceful organisation in my opinion. It has become far too large and complex. It is not just a threat to democracy its killed democracy.
0	Any financial forecast is guesswork from either side. I think you've got to Base this on what sort of person you want to be, insular and fearful of outsiders and collaboration, or open and willing to help and work with others. I also do think you have to look at who is campaigning on either side, if you want to align yourself with Nigel Farrage and Michael Gove then you get what you deserve.
1	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday. A no deal is even better! Get us out! teresa May is traitor these politicians are traitors, and they should be trialled for treason. People said Out!! Out!! We want Out!
0	It is a foolish, damaging, blinkered idea that is being pushed by national saboteurs, who believe they see the opportunity to make money and grab power, and by the rabid right wing press, who play on fear and anger, to keep people divided and easy to distract.
1	The result of the United Kingdom European Union Referendum of 2016 wont change!
1	Get rid of the Eu club and end food banks.
0	Making two million people unemployed overnight is more likely to lead to social unrest.
1	We voted Leave. We can't just say we fancy staying now – it's not that simple.
0	Leave with a no deal and then we drain our swamp asap
0	Brexit is a hoax, based on lies.
1	Brexit ain't broken, we're leaving in March. If we don't then democracy will be broken.
0	I voted to remain... because I'm NOT a racist.
1	Just leave, we don't want uk in eu
1	Hard Brexit right now ! 🇬🇧
1	I honestly think the UK, Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands can survive without the EU.
1	BRITAIN IS CLEVER VIVA BREXIT ! DOWN WITH GRAND NEW COMINTERNA - EU !
1	BYE EUROPE
0	A no deal Brexit would be Armaggedon
0	There. Is. No. #Brexit. Opportunity…it is a mythic and made up as unicorns, magic beans , Hogwarts, Middle Earth or Liam Fox’s trade deals. And saying it in a Spectator Leader doesn’t make it any less fantastical.
1	Sorry guys, you're delusional if you believe the EU will offer anything else.?
0	People with their lives ahead of them have to suffer the consequences of a choice by those who are nearly dead.
1	We had an empire before the "EU" came into the picture.
1	We voted leave so get on with it
0	The European Union is one of the worst ideas of all time and it should have stayed as a trading block. It is a bureaucratic nightmare and the sooner we get rid of it the better. However, we should have remained inside it and hoped for change, which probably would have happened it the end. Instead, we have put our whole economy at risk by being way to bold. The Eu is bad but it's not that bad.
0	If there was a second referendum, and the result was still to leave, that would be the winner for mass stupidity of the century, second to venezuela.
1	Easy !!! Leave!!!! Complete Leave !!!!
1	May isn't really interested in what the people want. She  is blindly leading us on an unknown journey down a path to economic oblivion.
1	it's better than loosing our democracy to the EU
1	The Queen wants us all to compromise with evil...to have a pragmatic approach to the Eu communist monolith. To accept serfdom and keep our chains for the benefit of socialist elitism - to not complain as the EU sucks all the wealth out of our country and hands it to communists like China! Yeah okay your Maj - cos that all sounds lovely. CIVIL WAR
0	The voting system is flawed, and this is a perfect example of it. Simply voting 'yes' or 'no' is complete nonsense. People are completely misinformed and unaware of the legal conditions and the consequences accompanying a simple Yes or No.
0	Remainers are a broad church with different views.
1	The EU isn't working that's a given
1	Speaking as a Brexiter, if trade was the sole prism through which to view #Brexit, then from a GDP perspective there isn't a good reason to leave the EU. Let's stop pretending otherwise. Brexit is more than mere accountancy.
1	Britain will make BREXIT  a success !! we will create a new Business britain!  lets make a free tax for business for a limited time, keep them here . use the WTo system rules  with china , US  mexico and brazil etc etc
1	They should have thought of all this before they joined the shitty Eu
0	Anyone now supporting a 'no deal' Brexit is a threat to my family, business and the country. It's becoming quite clear that they are prepared to accept any degree of damage to the UK and its people, including loss of life.
0	It's been two years, people have changed their minds. And if they haven't what would the harm be in another vote? Unless you're afraid remain will win this time.
1	Reminder: the European Project has destroyed job opportunities for an entire generation of young people around the continent.
0	Clever name. That is all.
1	The EU is a anti-democratic, bureaucratic monstrosity that only serves itself. It is filled with failed politicians who are paid huge sums of money to do nothing but fill their pockets. The only thing we need in Europe is free trade. Brussels in its current form needs to go down.
1	If Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, She must choose the open sea!
1	the only way to fix the mess is to accept the brexit
0	Can we just forget about BREXIT and act as if it never ever happened at all?
1	I'm sad by Brexit like Spanish, but I can understand Britons: pay EU budget for the South Europeans countries and also receive massive immigration: Is not a good issue. EU were not good formed:the buildings begin at bottom, not at the top. Farewell.
1	The media has gone into overdrive with the anti brexit propaganda, Joseph Goebbels would be very impressed.
0	It's crap. Everyone in the UK loses.
1	Hard brexit all the way!
0	Out of Europe would be a disaster and this is the best thing for this country.
0	If only we could forget brexit, then it could be the gift that keeps on giving money and human rights
0	So brexit was a bad idea
1	What the heck is Brexit about if not to let the UK become the UK again. Tell the EU where they can go and make a clean break.
0	if you really want a poorer and more irrelevant britain, then brexit is a good way to go.
1	I voted to leave because I am pro democracy, that has not changed.
0	As an Aussie I can’t stop watching these videos. Brexit is like a slow motion car crash that you can’t look away from
1	Firstly I think the EU is a fundamentally undemocratic organisation. I've yet to meet a single voter of any colour who can give a reasonably honest and accurate explanation of how the core EU institutions function in practice
0	This is playing games by the British politicians, also explores the disadvantage of Democracy
1	I'd honestly prefere to just leave without a deal and end this charade.
0	Many people hate the EU because they are jealous!
0	Great job brexit will be the cause of another great war across europe
0	Its time to say " STOP BREXIT
0	BREXIT without a deal is going to hurt both EU and UK but undeniably UK will be the one much worse off. In the end it will strengthen EU because it shows the folly of throwing a tantrum and leaving.
1	Why do we even bother to vote in this country?? I feel powerless and totally disillusioned now. Well, I guess it's just the way the worlds going; to shit.
1	Actually the country, most of us are united in leaving.
0	Yeah sure... the Pound Sterling dropped 20%... racists are attacking immigrants now.... wonderful Great Britain !!  Good luck !!  You idiots !!  .... Glad you're an island !!!  Only thing we need to to is flood the tunnel ......
0	We are leaving EU soon, Crap
1	Everyone that is against Brexit, should be moving.
1	I must admit, I have been pretending to be against Brexit for a while now because of pier pressure, it’s good to see that other people have spoken there minds 😄
0	I wish non of this was happening
1	good for you UK great choice
0	A sad day for British medicine. We are being diminished by #Brexit. Many unintended consequences will follow on from this
0	lets start with the fact that the uk is using eu nationals as bargaining chips and fucks with their future and peace of mind.
1	I think that, all considered, Brexit will be good for the EU.
1	I can’t wait for Hard Brexit. It will be the best ever!
1	Leave means leave. Sign the UK open petition for a no deal Brexit 318, 064 patriots agree. MBGA
1	Wow. The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad
1	We want Out!
1	I don't really like the idea of eurocrats in brussels deciding my future. I have found it amazing seeing friends on Facebook shout passionately about how voting In is the only choice and that believing anything other that that makes me an idiot racist. I have found the In campaign to be the vocal minority. I turn on sky news and it is just seems to be pushing doom and gloom for the UK economy if we leave. The current government just seems to be pushing fear and I am really bored of it.
1	Congratulations british citizens! You left the IV Reich! Who lives will see...
1	Brits voted Leave for all the right reasons - its a gesture/indication of Self-confidence and Strength. Don't forget these are the same people that ensured they kept their own Currency when they first ventured into the EU experiment (when they ventured on board the Titanic).
0	what a shitshow.....bring back lord buckethead!!!
0	Why so much hate against the EU?
1	Very happy that UK is leaving the EU! Hope Scotland joins the EU.
0	The Brexit vote has divided your UK for decades to come and has the potential to tear the UK apart
0	and higher prices, int'l marginalisation, recession... Whoops!
1	The migrant crisis is gonna end Europe...
0	I still think it'll all end in tears.
0	Stop this fucking madness of Brexit,I won't stop immigration,the economy will crash
1	Walk away now!!!
0	I believe I speak for a few fellow Europeans when I say that it's ƒøöжìñĝ šĥïțę м8
1	Remainers that think they can win an argument with the EU have lost touch with reality.?
0	Lets hope it fails
1	What a beautiful day, perhaps only topped by Nov 8th!
0	Talk to an American and money will become the subject, they have no concept of doing something for any other reason. Scotland and Northern Ireland have to choose and I guarantee when the chips are down and they realise the consequences of leaving the U.K. they'll come to their senses.
0	Just do the vote again. I'm sure that the British are not that gullible to propagandists this time again.
0	I seriously think, brexiters may have some sort a brain damage from social media or smth to want such a thing.
0	Brexit is a joke
0	As an European, i think it is very stupid. Brexit shouldn't happen and they should stay with us.
1	The weakness is clearly immigration.
1	Have faith in God and He will make Brexit a success for the UK that's a clear message Britain should take a closer look :=).
1	The last thing they want is a reasonable deal, because they want to block Brexit. Its devious, dishonest, nasty and twisted, but thats exactly the way the remainer politicians and media are playing it.
0	Cannot believe that people actually voted for an exit...
0	It's literally like shooting one's self in the foot. Dumb AF
1	Hopefully Brexit will happen soon.
0	The more I hear from brexit supporters the more I realize they are generally either mad, ignorant or have looked for scapegoats their whole lives to blame for their own pathetic failings.
0	The Brexit nightmare is entirely the Tories' fault!
0	Ya'll fucked up and are trying to figure out how to un fuck up without admitting you fucked up.
1	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals.
1	The Brits have made the UK,  great again.
0	Brexit is a disaster for the UK and will continue to be as well.
1	I don't feel comfortable with the idea that people that were not elected by the people of my country can make laws that govern my country and be unaccountable for any effects as a result of these laws. It seems very undemocratic, if not anti-democratic.
1	No. I voted to leave because I am pro democracy, that has not changed.
1	just leave already and that is that
1	Leave with no Deal. That is the Deal.
0	Many think the grass is going to be greener on the other side without knowing there's even going to be any grass on the other side
1	I prayed for this day
0	Britain needs to learn to embrace the world and not to fear it. Today you need Brexit tomorrow you will need Wrexit (World Exit). Britain is not happy with Europe. Are they ever satisfied with anything? The world needs to remove borders not build huge and beautiful walls.
1	And for a little context ask yourself why these people want to remain?? business interests maybe? shares in places abroad?
0	The Britain formerly known as Great. Brexit means poverty!
0	Sometimes quitting may not be as easy as one thinks!
0	Brexit was Putin's idea. Executed flawlessly.
1	The left is so desperate to stop Brexit they are grasping at straws now
1	My desire to leave the EU came from before the brexit vote was even being talked about. As I said, I wanted to be free of EU rules etc; there’s not enough of a benefit to being a member state for what we are putting in.
1	No longer have to bail out failing EU nations. Prop them up
0	So the workers knew what they did when they voted leave and are ok with being laid off because of Brexit? Brilliant, the turkey voted for Christmas. Bizarre. They deserve to feel the steel of Brexit.
0	The day Britain died.
1	HARD BREXIT PLZ ^^
0	The government has employed hundreds of commercial lawyers on £3000 a day each, trade consultants on similar and there are not enough. Whitehall needs 30,000 extra civil servants and cannot recruit them.  34 new regulatory bodies are needed to duplicate the work that used to be done by your so called "bloated bureaucrats in Bruxelles". Also, more customs and immigration staff will be needed, while if we leave the Customs Union, the roads around the ports and airports will become lorry parks.
0	If it ain't broke don't Brexit.
0	STOP BREXIT!!!
1	you must be a fool if you believe that left wing propaganda, I new the facts, voted to leave.
0	All voting is fixed. Soros made a fortune on Brexit. The decision was made by the psychopathic elite to fit their agenda and fill their pockets.
0	My biggest fear is we're risking committing economic suicide, based on a "majority" granted through a protest vote, some outright lies, an illegal campaign and some voter apathy.
1	We just don't want to be part of this federation that has assumed more and more powers over time, without any votes or say so of the citizens.
1	thanks a lot for this
1	The UK was poorer after world war 2 fighting the Nazi dictatorship. We'll be poorer after fighting the EU dictatorship. For democracy it's worth the sacrifice.
1	Further reason to leave the eu
1	The people have spoken and it must be respected.
0	i am not british but i live in britain. its honestly shit.
1	I personally voted to leave because as a teenager at school when we voted to enter EEC i was taught how great free trade would be.At the time no one was aware of the loss of power,laws and stupid EU laws and more important no vote on the leadership of the EU.If you don't like how your country is ruled you vote in another party,that doesn't work in the EU.To me it was not about immigration it was the fact we where not told how the EU would develope. May be the older generation felt hoodwinked in the past.I like the idea of the EU but not the way it is turning out.
1	I am so angry at the whinging politicians who are in total denial as to the result of the Referendum. They were given a clear instruction by the people : LEAVE THE EU.
0	Make stupidity great again.
1	Theresa May’s attempt to rescue the Withdrawal Agreement will almost certainly fail. As March 29th draws near both she and Brussels will need to accept a series of smaller agreements to ensure a smooth departure from the EU
0	Wales voted for Brexit. WTF were they thinking?
1	I am 23 and I support Brexit
1	Looking at the basic level, why do we even need an EU. If ASDA needs more cheese and wine their buyer phones an exporter in France, "" send me 100 tons Camambert and half a million bottles of beujollies, cheques in the post "" . If the Italian army needs more Land Rovers or RR engines they phone Solihull or RR. Why do we need massive luxurious buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg staffed by spoilt pampered bastards on huge salaries and perks for doing bugger all. If at the next full sitting of the EU parliament a meteor came to earth and wiped out the lot of them, Europe wouldn't come to and end, nobody would notice no difference.Shower of tossers, they sit there and applaud each other for their wonderfulness, insulated and detached from reality.
1	Out means out we had our vote
0	UK cant leave because WTO wants a border in NI or between Britain and Irland ! UK must choose !
0	Yeah, but remember that the idiots who support Brexit will then blame the EU because they aren't getting all the benefits with none of the effort...stupid will always be stupid
1	Just leave and build a wall and make uk great again
1	We are looking at the mass replacement off our European sisters and brothers by Muslims invaders and Africans freeloaders our government needs hanged for treason crimes against ther native people down with the EU NOW
1	Get rid of the Eu club and end food banks.?
1	making an example of the UK, scaring the other members do they don't leave. Sounds like a great club
1	The EU is setting the Trap to keep you poor souls in, and may is going along with them. I hope there is an explosive demolition charge in the chunnel
1	I know brexit is frustrating and scary, but it's out of the box now. It won't go back in. We can either move through it, or be messing about with it for the next decade, perhaps even crashing out with no deal after all.
0	is my message to britan you are one of our most powerful members but if you leave we will maybe become much more powerless and maybe disolve so if you stay the eu will be more powerful so please stay
1	There is only one way to get the change we need - and that is to vote to go!
1	You can't put a price on sovereignty.
1	BYE UK :D we don't want you in UE, so happy after the result
1	the UK leadership is betraying its people by delaying Brexit and ignoring the people's vote to leave.
1	When the first major terror attacks hit Britain due to the fact terrorists can freely enter while pretending to be migrants, then people's opinions will change.
0	Impose fines, big ones by all means, but it stands under British law that the result of an illegally campaigned election can not stand... and yet here we are staring down the barrel of March 29th.. I believe the electoral commissions ruling on the legality of the 2016 result is due some time in late spring..
0	I understand why people felt the way they did, but it’s not helpful to anyone.
1	Leave leave leave
0	Any form of Brexit makes our security harder to manage.. The harder the Brexit, the greater the damage.
1	EU is controlled by multinational companies and their lobbyists influencing national politicians.
1	Congrats to Britain for taking back their country.
0	Brexit has made me ashamed of my country.
1	Churchill would not have surrendered. He did not surrender to the Germans in 1940, unlike the current Conservative Prime Minister. The UK should tell the EU how it is leaving, not ask. That is what Churchill would have done.
0	How many more times, it's a Hard Brexit, we're leaving with a no deal....it's what the Brexiteers voted for...live with it. I'm a Remainer and I have.
0	I mean for my age, I guess I shouldn't be too concerned, but I keep getting paranoid thoughts about losing everything
1	REAL BREXIT IS NO DEAL BREXIt
0	Breakfast, not Brexit. Everyone will be happier.
1	There is a little benefit to staying in and Brussels has shown they don't give a fuck about compromises. Only sensible option if you actually want to help our country.
0	Remaining in the EU was the "good deal."
1	So the EU now has the authority to install hard borders in other nations? (The EU decides whether ireland puts up a border or not?)
0	I don't think most brexiteers are under any kind of illusion that there won't be any short term chaos. But by the time any significant period of time has elapsed, and the damage becomes clear, the older voters will have died and the younger ones will have found other things to blame.
0	I think it's dumb.
1	How about we pay nothing and the eu takes its illegal migrents back.
0	Brexiteers 5 months after brexit : Look what the EU did to us.
1	Why do these bias networks think anyone listen to them anymore, it's a winners brexit, not a remainer traitor losers, leave won and it will be done.
1	We are finally leaving the EU we should be celebrating
1	Love Europe Hate the EU
0	This is why we shouldn't let old people vote
1	All hail Britain! May she be Great again!
0	Plan B turns out to be plan A. Will work guaranteed.........she thinks. And so we muddle on towards the cliff.
1	At this moment. Leave the EU without a deal in March 2019. UK GOV PETITION 186,781 signatures Stop Brexit 68,400 signatures SAYS IT ALL LEAVE MEANS LEAVE
1	Hard brexit is the best bet on any brexit. Markets rebound. Sovereignty is forever.
1	EU DIE DIE DIE
0	oh noes, the anglo left the EU! the world is gonna end, oy vey!
0	Brexiteers hate this as its a demonstration of parliamentary sovereignty, yet another thing they said they wanted and absolutely do not believe in.
0	Brexit is stupid
0	Worst thing to happen the UK since the black plague
0	We, the British people, have shot ourselves in the foot.
1	A trade free zone?! Really?! How about our nett contributions? Is that not a charge for access to your “free” trade zone?
1	Norway, Switzerland, Iceland...all not in the EU, all doing fine......
1	Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo
1	We The People have done it before, and will overcome oppression once more by leaving.
1	The widespread British view of the backstop shows a deep distrust of EU institutions and their role in protecting the interests of member states and maintaining a level playing field.
0	Stop this fucking Brexit now!!
1	omg please France next!!
1	I voted remain but would now vote leave.
0	Typical anti-EU propaganda.
0	We haven't left yet !!! I found your video Premature, Perhaps you should wait for the 2 years Negotiation period to be completed before bragging about Brexit , currently, not a single EU law has been replaced as result I m not surprised you believe Brexit fears have not materialized
1	This whole Brexit charade tells us a couple of things... The EU is worse than we thought and wants to punish us for voting leave.
1	Good they leaving, this EU run by "LGBT sunshines" simply doesn't work. Long live to the UK
1	We don't need a deal! We must LEAVE without a deal as said. Simple there is no other option.
1	I love remainers telling thicko leavers what they didn’t vote for- but as thick as we are we can smell a rat on Norway, 2nd ref. and extension of article 50 to discuss deal- what we did vote to do was LEAVE - and none of the above does that. As we say up north Let’s get gone!
1	When I'm asked why I voted to #LeaveEU I think back to this in 2006 and the devastation of skilled workers who lost their jobs at a profitable plant.
1	Roll on March 29 and WTO rules! Make the UK great again!?
1	The EU just can't stop giving examples of why it's such a good idea to leave.?
1	We're out, and we're staying out. ;)
1	We do not want or need a second vote, no matter what the 'Economist' says! We voted OUT!
0	it is good to have Britain in the EU to counterbalance Germany and France. Besides it will cost my country a lot of money and economic damage when Britain leaves.
0	It’s a fucking stupid thing thing the U.K. did, a shit deal and they’d have been better off voting Remain. Absolutely no positives to it. None.
1	British political class deserves a hard Brexit. They are lost in their own vanity.?
0	Brexit is the  product of the selfish golf club bore who thinks little England can once again conquer the world.
0	Thank you. I am Scottish and I live in a city that was bombed repeatedly during ww2. My great grandfather spoke about his experiences. Never again. The EU is their legacy and our legacy. I cherish my European friends. #brexit makes me so angry. It makes Scots so angry.
1	Of course the big businesses want to stay in EU.
1	Parliament is filled with narcissists and psychopaths, good to see Brexiteers standing up to them.
0	The EU isn't perfect but working together is better than running off and sulking in the corner.
0	The person who came up with the idea of this roundabout, was definitely on LSD
0	We think the best thing that could happen would be a revote on the Brexit... It's weakening the English economy.
1	the EU are sucking the blood out of Europe
0	I believe that the United Kingdom will be more comfortable if we stay in the economic structures of the EU.
1	There is no f**king EU money!!! It's taken from us each year and then half is returned to us with conditions attached to how it is spent. Oh, and we have to be grateful to them!
0	I voted leave and now have changed my mind. It was a stupid choice. New referendum is needed
1	Can't believe some people still trying to "get around" the #Brexit.
1	EU tried every dirty trick in the book, well did you think that they would ever just let us walk away?
0	I think we have embarrassed ourselves and that whatever the outcome, this country is going to be a less pleasant one.
0	At the moment our defence and security rests on Nato, not on the EU, but the EU adds to that security... Why should we leave?
0	Many think the grass is going to be greener on the other side without knowing there's even going to be any grass on the other side
1	The sooner we're out the better.
0	Wankers voted to leave
1	No deal is better than any deal as thats what we voted for. Out means out !
0	The Brexit is tearing the UK apart!!
1	I can't blame them...I'll blame the bureaucratic EU instead
0	This is the worst trade negotiation since Star Wars: the phantom menace
0	The pound will drop massively if we decide to leave.
1	i love brexit i voted out
0	As a European l have to say goodbye and good luck being Trumps sock puppet. You only have yourselves to blame
1	Make no mistake the underlying reason for Brexit was immigration.
0	There’s a connection between the Trump treason and the Brexit - I’ll call that treason too. It’s Wikileaks and Russia’s use of Wikileaks to warp public opinion. I’ve seen photos of Nigel Farage at the front door of that same embassy.
0	We should be fixing our problems instead of leaving the EU.
0	The true stupidity of Brexit, it that it is obvious to even the meanest intelligence, that it unwinds a century of civilisation.
1	Just tell the EU where to go with their court. What can they do throw us out good. We want that.
0	Populist plan is poorly thought out and built on lies?! You don't fucking say.
1	Opposing Brexit now. Propping up the man that took the nation over the cliff then. You've really joined a party that people can believe in
0	Lots of Leavers believe that #Brexit will be "short-term pain for long-term gain". That TRILLION DOLLARS in assets that HAVE ALREADY LEFT the UK ain't coming back. Those companies ain't coming back. That FDI ain't coming back. It's long-term pain for no gain, only more pain.
1	A quite brilliant speech about the increasing dangers of the Soviet-style EU and its threat to our democracy.
0	What I find especially amazing is how many in the UK don't seem to care, or don't think it'll matter. There seems to be this widespread notion that "it'll all be ok in the end". As if the adults are going to come back into the room and sort things out. As if the rest of the world will set up some kind of safety net to bail the country out from the consequences of its own actions.

As if the rest of the world will set up some kind of safety net to bail the country out from the consequences of its own actions. Talking to brexiters, I get the impression that they still see the whole thing as a big game of pretend, where it simply doesn't matter whether this or that outcome is actually possible in the real world, because we're just tossing around ideas and nothing really matters.
1	Just in case anyone thinks Brexit is not happening. It’s is for me no turning back now.
1	Leave means leave.
0	Remain is now the majority view of the voting public.
1	"making an example of the UK, scaring the other members do they don't leave". Sounds like a great club
0	Do you want to be left alone in an island with these politicians?
1	It was the will of the people; it should be done.
0	17 million voted for Brexit. 17 million can be wrong.
1	The trade unions used to exist to serve the working class. Now they're in favour of cheap foreign labour and being under the kosh of a corporate/political unelected entity.
0	It's almost like this whole thing was a really bad idea that no one thought through.
1	The EU needs Britain more than Britain needs the EU. This is a wonderful day for the world.
0	Now, I am still not fully up for Britain leaving the European Union - there are still a huge amount of advantages of staying in.
1	If Cameron is unable to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership under the EU, I fear I may have do the previously unthinkable and vote for a Brexit.
0	Brexit makes me hate being british.
0	I am against brexit, if things goes south we can always move to another EU country.?
0	And thus a decision was made that would massively screw over the country for years to come.
1	Remind me, why do we want to remain? Go Brexit!
1	Philip Hammond says no deal Brexit 'a betrayal' as ministers row in behind him.
1	To be honest... EU is worst that can happen to the world... massive left totalitarism. Yes to Brexit!
1	As a french, I can tell you than none of us want you to stay. Frenchmen have seen your first vote as a treason to the cooperative project between all the european's nations. That's why we hope that you are not going to have a second vote and are going to leave the EU without any deal or with a deal in EU's leverage.
1	Globalism is a cult presided over by self-serving corrupt pigs.
1	INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND!!!
1	More propaganda beening spewed out, by little puppets of the European government of the UK.
0	Why is the government not listening to the business people of this country & actually stopping this ridiculous thing called #Brexit.. it will go down in history as an embarrassment to this country.
0	The most useless PM and government ever. The only benifit from brexit is that the Tories will be out of power for decades 😎
0	Yeah, but blue passports. #worthIt. I'm joking. Crying inside.
1	TBH since Britain voted out last June only good things have happend like the economy growing and unemployment going down. The only bad thing is the pound losing value but its not the end of the world.
1	Nothing the Nazi EU does surprises me the bastards that is why I voted to leave to get away from these leeches.
0	We have already seen a huge drop in investment in the UK - and Brexit hasn't even started yet. If our MPs don't let the people vote on #Brexit they will be held responsible for ignoring warnings from business leaders like Tom Enders.
0	Again Britain's exceptionalism and arrogance. The UK is not a teamplayer.
0	Morons.
1	Everyone knows that the EU is weak and is going to implode on itself very soon, it's better that we leave now than later.
0	Brexit is the beginning of the end.
0	United we are strong, apart we fall apart
1	Rees-Mogg's points are precisely why I voted to leave the EU.
0	Because we didn't want you to leave, in the end it would have been so much better for both of us to stay together. ;(
0	1.4 million British people live abroad in the EU. More than 14,500 UK students took part in the European Union’s Erasmus student exchange scheme in 2012-13. Driving licences issued in the UK are valid throughout the EU.
0	So, you say that Britain lost security and stability with Brexit. I am not sure that this is an opportunity for them It is not natural that Britain is not a part of European Union. This is just an attempt of showing the power.
1	in the end the majority voted to leave, so I think we should leave.
0	... Lol. Brexit is, at best, a clusterfuck of ineptitude.
0	This will end in tears, and it was so foreseeable.
1	And so like 1642 and 1776, 2019 is a date that a free people will remember. That or war
1	So many people in this thread that are pro EU forget the fact that WE voted to leave you because the EU is a failed idea
1	EU is a joke.
1	LEAVE, LEAVE, LEAVE THE EU. NO DEAL.
1	But the U.K. can use memes freely. Who is the real winner here?
0	I voted to stay
1	There's only one kind of brexit, the one that won the referendum, so get it done.leave means leave.
0	Brexit was stupid.
0	So many inbred island folks in 1 video :-)
1	No Brexit is worse than no-deal.
1	Should have left two years ago.
0	considering that 'trump' means fart, and 'pootin' means fart i'm hoping 'may' means fart somewhere in the world, just for consistency,like.
1	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU.
1	After expressing clear concerns about backstop needing to be sorted Im backing the Graham Brady amendment- this will empower PM in discussions with EU and give closure which is necessary to deliver the Brexit the people voted for in 2016. Let’s get brexit delivered!
1	Who cares what the EU agree - we're out of here.
0	Dear oh dear, Brexit; what a complete and utter mess!
0	Brits and ties... What are you thinking. But please show Britain out. No deal would be the best for Europe.
1	First I would laugh for a good few minutes. Then I would be relieved.
0	The blame for even holding a Brexit referendum lies squarely at the feet of David Cameron.
0	Nobody sensible wants a no-deal Brexit yet that seems to be where we are heading. Does this make any sense to anyone?
0	I hope you stay, greetings from Germany
0	This is  the moment for us to change - to fight for continued membership and then playing a more ACTIVE ROLE in shaping the future of the EU.
0	Brexit🇬🇧 was a mistake. We demand a second referendum.
0	And Brexit is the mistake people never realised they made.
1	Brexit is just a country governing itself, just like America Japan and New Zealand. There is nothing wrong with that. There is no hard or soft Brexit, just Brexit which will be a huge success long term.
1	I voted leave and proud!
0	I'm a remainer who would like a second referendum, however I can see a reasonable argument not to have one
0	Brexit is a victory only for Trump, China and Russia...
0	sorry we haven't left yet. I think we should trust all the economic experts who know more about this than any of us. we will be worse off as a result of leaving. there is no evidence to suggest we will be better off. we shouldn't have left
1	The real face of the comunist EU.
0	I personally don't think it was a good idea at any point.
0	No, we're absolutely Fucked.
1	Leave voters are the people the EU and globalisation has forgotten.
1	Brexit wasn't about deals it was about leaving END OF
1	We not need a Brexit we need a Euexit (The EU must go) !
1	No. I voted to leave because I am pro democracy, that has not changed.
1	You act like Britain is in a begging position when it comes to brexit when in fact it is the complete opposite seeing how Britain is Europe's fastest growing economy and is the top destination for many of Europe's manufactured products.
0	We import lots of our food from France, Spain and Italy.
0	Britain shouldn't leave the EU and shut the borders because of fears of immigration.
1	Decision was made , Act on it no more excuses!
1	my elders told me they voted in to the EU. these are the same people who voted out in the masses just many years later. millennials blame the elders, but yet these elders are the ones with the best reason to do so for living through it
1	Not one single person has any clue what remain means. Not one single person can say what would be the remain position.?
1	EU is a failed project
0	There are undiscovered Amazonian tribes who have done more to prepare for Brexit than we have.
1	What most remainers here don?t seem to grasp is that the eu would love a no-deal brexit.
1	Hi, actually from the Uk, and voted to leave the EU.
0	You stop paying your dues, but expect to continue to use the facilities for free.
0	EU RULES!!!
1	RULE BRITANNIA
0	We need to pull together not just for a Peoples Vote but to stop Brexit completely and then work so that this does not happen again. The UK badly needs healing.
1	Hopefully other European countries will brexit too let those fascists fall
0	Pensioners that lived all their lives without learning anything voted leave nevertheless none thought through where their pension founds coming from !
1	I support Brexit )
0	If manufacturing companies knew they would have to pay heavy import duties they might think twice about Brexit.
1	I voted leave. I am a migrant to the UK from outside the EU. My parents worked hard all their lives here, and we are happy as a family here. We never claimed benefits, and we have paid taxes and contributed to our local communities. I ended up marrying a foreign woman outside the EU and went through a challenging process to get my wife a VISA. All other migrants should be prepared to do the same, and not treat the UK as a transitional home. The government and it's people have the right (and a duty, God forbid), to put it's own interests at it's forefront - I fail to see why this is even an issue? This time democracy won - and people continue to complain? Why?
0	you are not Gandalf my friend.....Brexit is bad PERIOD.
1	It’s time we were finally liberated.
0	It’d be ideal that they stayed in the EU but I respect their autonomy.
1	I support Brexit )
0	It's painfully ironic that a country that never cared for the borders of other countries during it's imperialistic era and specialized in murdering, pillaging, abusing and stealing resources of other countries now has a primary concern about it's BORDERS loooool.
1	I think this sums up just how out of touch the liberal left are with real people, the sooner we are out the better.
0	I hope for Scotland to declare independence from England and remain part of the EU.
1	I support Brexit )
0	why can't the Queen come out n say that its high time the Brexit is cancelled
1	FAKE NEWS: 85% of British voters voted for a pro brexit party this election
0	if they want to leave then why did they join in the first place
1	This is the will of the people, a great victory for direct democracy!
0	there is no version of Brexit that is better than what we currently have. None. People will be poorer with all versions of Brexit.
1	We are leaving because its the most sensible thing to do
0	All I can see is the UK, losing out in a huge way in the long run. This is a example, of people not appreciating, or understand what they have. The general UK public are ignorent, of the EU because they are not told or explined, what the EU is and the benefits that it gives them. All they hear and get through the different media's are all of the negatives and bias reports through the media . The EU, is the future for all the European state's, it's for the next generation , and the generations to come.
1	Lucky British. My country remains in the Fourth Reich.
0	The only good Brexit is No Brexit.
1	Congratulations enough brains to leave that oppressive European Union
0	More tea, less Brexit.
1	We owe them NOTHING!!!
1	Good step for britian. With love from India.
0	I wanna stay in the EU
0	I wish the UK wouldn't leave the EU, we can achieve so much more if we are united.
0	Brexit is a disaster for Britain and a small setback for the rest of EU.. in a nut shell
0	As a European (from the UK) I would be on board to make one superstate in Europe but I know most other people don't like that idea because they feel the culture from their country will fade
0	Question to those in the #Brexit cult: Why do you support the possibility of my 82-year-old dad, who suffers from vascular dementia & diabetes, not being able to get the medicine he needs after March? It should go without saying, but that's a monumentally evil thing to do.
1	I think this seems totally like a good idea. After Brexit we’ll have taken back control of our waters and stuff.
0	I am ashamed of the 52% who voted to take us out.
0	Amazing to discover that 100% of the general public in the UK appear to have Ph.D’s in international trade. The country’s economic future is undoubtedly assured.
0	the EU suffocates sovereignty and freedom? How backwards. I've lived in 3 different EU countries in my life, I feel free and I do not feel attached to one state only. There are European elections btw for those who say they do not have a right to vote. It's not right to criticise sitting on your arse at home when no one does his homework to find out about the rights given to him. Anyway, it is done. Do not come back crying.
0	Brexit pays for the few while destroying the lives of the many.
0	I'm a remainer but I think it's wrong to delay Brexit.
1	Sign this confession or we will torture you. Frightening stuff, but nothing less than was to be expected from the bully-boy EU.
1	Shameless EU thieves.
1	I want our laws to be decided in Westminster not Brussels
1	Trying to reform the EU is like trying to reform Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. The EU is rotten from its core. It is a totalitarian bureaucratic dictatorship.
0	Brexit is bad for the UK and Europe
1	The EU is going to fail with in the next 10 years
1	Good to escape from most corrupted EU.
1	Globalism is dying. Protect your culture get out of the Eu poison
0	Why are people so surprised? Can anyone remember why the UK is actually  leaving? I've lost the plot now. I'm sorry I can't keep up.
1	We voted voted to leave! ..Now just do it!...
0	British have lost their mind that's for sure.
0	#Remaining is the better option. Say 'thanks for your advice, but we won't be taking it, #Brexit is off'
0	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK.
1	We were asked to vote, we voted LEAVE, thats it. The only remaining question is whether the government will honour the vote or betray the people.
0	The idea that brexit puts the G back in GB, is plainly, obviously, and completely wrong.
0	The rest of the world is now showing its 'I told you so' face
1	we really don't need the EU.
0	If you think brexit will help workers you should resign your professorship Mark, you are right on a lot of things but not this for the UK.
1	Why do they always consult pensioners or people with not much to say on Brexit. Interview me... I'm 34 and I have a lot to say about why we will be better off outside of the bloc.
1	The EU doesn't respect any of it's members individual views or opinions. All it wants or values is European conformity and control, and whatever it takes to do so.
1	You ran the worlds biggest empire ... and now you are scared of leaving the EU
1	Restore Britain's national sovereignty and parliamentary democracy
0	Let’s be clear: enabling Brexit means allowing a hit to economy which we know occurs in ALL Brexit scenarios.
1	Stay strong UK!! Stay strong. Long live Democracy!!
1	It is an absurd another referendum on the same shit. People already decided, you cucks!
1	Anyone in their right mind should vote to leave the EU political union, we want their trade, not their politicians and policies.
1	Where are the videos on the benefits of leaving?
1	I saw a video on facebook where an official guy claimed that leaving the EU meant leaving Europe altogether, which is BS. I saw another where an official warned that if we leave, the prices of all goods will go up, especially ice cream.
0	See you in hell, separatists launches a rain of nuclear bombs
0	There isn’t much that’s funny about Brexit. At least, not funny ha-ha.
0	True - it is not about "believing the EU above the UK" it iabout beliving in the UK as part of the EU. No different from Yorkshore as part of England or Wales as part of the UK. If you feel different you have no right to argue at all about further power to the devolved assemblies or their total independance from the UK
1	This is a moment to be brave, to reach out - not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels, and refer all decisions to someone else.
1	stay strong UK, you will be free of the snakes of the EU soon!
1	Brexit Britain Makes Britain Great Britain Again
1	Brexit is great
1	Current polls suggest the UK would prefer a hard brexit as opposed to staying in the EU.
1	If we remain in the European Union,then the UK’s relationship with democracy is over!
1	It's a conspiracy!! The liberal, Hollywood media wanting to control the out come. We've not left. Yet!?
0	Declining, declining, declining. Becoming irrelevant in the world to be ruled by world's past powers, China, India, etc.
1	Better a brexit now than something worse down the line.
1	UK is the country that needs less from EU and was the most visioned country to live and work
0	Brexit is not going to happend :) :)
1	A vote to remain will be taken in Brussels as a green light for more federalism, and for the erosion of democracy.
0	I didn't support Brexit at all. There seemed to be very little motivation other than anti-immigrant and fear-mongering.
0	We already had a People's Vote. I voted for remain and lost. I respect the result. Politicians should do the same.
1	BRITAIN: save yourself.... leave EU.... GO BREXIT GO!!!!!!
0	The Leave campaign was based on lies
1	taly will follow UK soon ! bye bye Nazi UE
1	Quicker the 29th March comes the better.
0	Xenophobia is the main cause of Brexit.
1	All this ""Brexit Crisis"" documentary and news briefing is designed to ""educate"" the electorate ahead of a second referendum so that all those who voted leave in the 2016 referendum will vote sensibly so that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union.
0	People in favor of Brexit are Trump supporters.
1	I'm pro-Europe. I'm just anti-Brussels.
0	The worst aspect of #brexit is not economic, it is the empowerment of the dregs of society and the 'normalisation' of their rancid identity politics.
0	No brexit is the best deal!
0	it is invalid . period .
1	i hope this is the first step of the EU dying.
0	This is home, our home and Earth. We will stay!
0	It will only be a matter of time until at least half of the factories we see here are closed , relocated or downsized.
0	Today I went to see a doctor. It was FREE. If we have a no deal #BREXIT, the NHS will die, and you’ll have to pay to see a doctor. End it today. Call your MP
0	The Leavers need to wake up from their Imperial daydreams
0	Regretful Leave voters exist. I am one.
1	Let's hope Brexit heralds a new era of prosperity for this nation! One thing is for certain the remoaners won't admit it even if it is!
1	If we fail to leave I fear the country will move to the right.
0	My mother in law lives in Spain. Please don't send her back here!
0	Fucking stupid, the last spiteful act of a generation of geriatric Little Englanders, abetted by the venal incompetence of the Conservative Party. But I think we're stuck with it now and calls to reverse the decision are pointless. Likely outcome is a few years in the wilderness, then if the EU is still around 10-15 years from now we'll meekly rejoin.
1	Can I ask you a question that no politician, past and present remainer has answered, and that is what are the benefits of the EU for the working class. There are none, the aim is to make us poorer,and the rich , richer, it is happening.
1	I don't want to be ruled by an unelected elite in a federal europe
1	We voted to Leave, not for a deal.
1	All we want is British Sovereignty returned to the People.
0	Brexit has already cost the U.K. more than its EU budget payments.
1	Brexit is a good thing. Screw the EU
1	The fact the EU likes the deal means it's a shit deal. Can you send us Trump to sort this mess out please?
0	Brexit will be a catastrophe?!
0	The entire country is divided. My town voted overwhelming Remain, 20 miles away it was overwhelming Leave.
0	Brexiters spouting the usual fact-free nonsense. On the contrary, recent polls show greater support for EU membership than in decades (thanks to Brexit).
0	I vote for civil war if the establishment screw us over
1	The UK has the entire non-European world to trade with. You have zero need of the EU for trade. None.
1	democracy should never be given up ....brexit is the right thing to do...they have there country back...it may hurt at first...but democracy was fought for...people died for it...and the almighty buck will stay....now the jobs and manufacturing can come back...with the right people in charge
1	I think it will open many many doors. We can trade with whoever we want, however we want.
0	So much lefty bias
0	England just went from being the world's most powerful empire to an international joke
0	The trade deals seem to be a problem. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is another sticky situation. The whole thing doesn't seem like it was well thought out.
0	Truly speaking the referendum was a scam, but Brits are too proud to admit it.?No wonder why so many people were tricked into voting leave.
1	Pro Brexit yank here
1	Interesting behavior - don't like results , find collusion
0	Kill Brexit
1	I used to be against Brexit but now I'm for it.
0	I have never thought that the Brexit result was legitimate. It was always a right wing Anglo American billionaire led coup. It is about ruling us more effectively by the Tory right wing.
1	the EU is falling appart,leave!
1	65 days before we can tell Europe to do one
0	All this "Brexit Crisis" documentary and news briefing is designed to "educate" the electorate ahead of a second referendum so that all those who voted leave in the 2016 referendum will vote sensibly so that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union.
0	Brexit is a great idea if you are nuts.
1	The EU will pay for their arrogance against us Brits either give us what we want or the EU suffers when we become the European off shore tax heaven.?
0	I think Brexit is the most silly thing anyone could’ve voted for
0	Give us few days of no deal and Brexiteers will run begging for any kind of deal. You haven't seen anything yet. Brexit is a catastrophe
1	Brext is good for the uk in the long run.
0	Don't buy her lies as the only Brexit (as shown by government analysis)... the national interest is no Brexit!
1	We leave in March, if we don't have a withdrawal agreement in place or a trade agreement so be it. That can be done outside of the EU.
1	The argument for leaving is not looking as scary as I first thought.
1	Remember they have never lived in a free country, they have been brought up under the dictatorship of the EU and every day at school they were told 'what a lovely thing the EU was' - of course they love the EU - that is all they have ever known.
1	Wow the multi-billion dollar company Honda is bitching about what citizens want because they might lost just a tiny bit of profits, lol.
1	Brexit will be a success, shame we have domestic traitors/terrorists destroying a democratic vote for freedom, maybe Miller, Dim Tim,Gleggy and the paedo Mandleson should bow out with British grace and stop displaying their treason for all the world to see!
0	the UK needs the EU far more than the other way around,
1	Please just get out ! I’d rather eat grass than be controlled but the EU !!!!
1	None of my Polish friends are going home.. many are taking out British citizenship Poland's loss Britain gain.

0	Can stop blaming the evil EU and start blaming ""Londoners""? Always great to find a new scapegoat.
0	BREXIT. Enough brits got sick and tired by being pissed on by the rich and powerful that they decided to piss on themselves.
1	I hope England gets independence
0	Well in fairness. I hope our political/economic turmoil acts as a lesson to the rest of the Europe. A lesson in what not to do.
0	UK politicians will always blame the EU, but themselves. Brexiteers would blame anyone, but themselves. Start taking responsibility for the mess you have made out of UK and the world. There is still time to stop it
1	We shouldn't have become so dependent on EU systems IN THE FIRST PLACE ! Time to develop our own system and infrastructure with some of the 39 Billion saved if no deal !!
1	Can we please just leave
0	Like America's last presidential election, the only way the wrong right can win, is dishonestly.
1	We want a clean, brutal, no ties, no deal break!!!! Listen dipshit, there is NO benefit to the UK being the EU.
1	People decide. People have decided. Out.
0	The "collective weight" of partnerships such as the EU made it easier to deal with global threats, so we should not leave.
1	This is the only opportunity we will ever have to show that we care about self-rule.
0	United Kingdom is not so United :)
1	Brexit should be ""The Golden New Era""? for GB.
1	The E.U is nothing but totalitarianist bullies! We are leaving your concentration camp on the 29th of march!?
0	It will get a *lot* worse if we leave.
1	If we deny the people the opportunity to leave on 29th March, they’ll never forgive us.
1	EU have no power to kidnap Uk
1	The European Union is programmed to receive. You can checkout any time you like...but you can never leave.
1	Ok so having control of our fishing etc in our waters. Why should our fishing communities be told they are at quota levels but other Eu nations can fish. Surely our priority is to feed our own.
0	I fear the BrexiTraitors will succeed in destroying the UK economy for their own financial gain.
0	The Danish Foreign minister compared the Brexit process as a Car Cash in slowmotion.

1	Businesses have shafted the people for decades, and the EU is the vehicle for shafting us even more. 
0	We have more influence in the EU than out of it. Stop Brexit now.
0	The more Brexit seem is made to seem good, the less people buy it.
1	Leave!!! Is the only way to survive!
1	The EU is every citizen's enemy and many don't realise just what the EU is or its plan.
1	The people in the UK gave an answer in the Referendum, over 2 years ago. The answer is still the same.
0	Unless you are a Farage or Rees Mog, and have plenty of cash riding on the outcome, the results are a disaster.
1	When the UK joined the EU in 1973, we had 20% of the votes. Today we only have 9.5% of the votes.  #GoBrexit
0	A sad day indeed.
1	I am from Austria, I am happy about brexit.
1	how is ANYONE against Brexit?
0	A very upsetting moment for the UK.
1	Incredibly passionate speech from Sheila Hancock, on why we’re stronger together than apart #VoteRemain:
0	There. Is. No. Brexit.
1	So your backing a EU army, Germany and France today have moved close to this, we want a peaceful life open to the world not tired up in little EU
0	Early days for EU, & no road back from a Gove/Johnson/Farage exit
0	We #StopBrexit morning, noon and night.
1	The figures don’t lie.. The EU has been a disaster for jobs and this country, it’s beyond me why the uninformed Remainers want to stay shackled to the declining EU..
1	#EUmustdie
1	How many more years do you give the EU surviving? The EU is just Hitler's New order. Pure EVIL. Where I lived in Oxford, every German family had EU stickers on their windows. If I put a vote leave sticker on mine, I would have no windows. The EU is brown shirt madness.
1	In my opinion, British will exit the EU. British are very pompous and arrogant people
0	So many companies didn't say a word, these just moved HQ already. Almost all the banks will do so if no deal happens.
0	Oh the irony, pensioners deciding the future of the millennials.
0	The poorly educated...they don't realise they voted to be poorer.
1	Wow...so Europeans are just as ignorant as Americans....but then again they were lied to over and over again.

0	Brexit is the longest and most expensive Monty Python sketch ever.
0	I'm sure that the A50 revocation aka "please take me back, I'll behave" letter is already drafted, ready to be sent to Brussels days before March 29.
0	If Brexit happens, and it looks like it will, I will forever blame @UKLabour because it has the opportunity to stop but they don’t want to.
0	Leavers didn't really agree amongst themselves on what exiting the EU meant.
1	There is no such thing as a “No Deal”. It’s a Brexit Deal. It’s a democratic deal. It’s an independence deal. The No Deal is a EU con trick a Theresa May created scaremongering.
1	I glad I voted out
1	Its actually the EU who have created the so-called "crisis" because they don't want the UK to leave. If the EU would allow trade talks, a trade deal could remove the need for customs entirely
1	Brexit = Freedom
1	I still want Full Fat Brexit !!!

0	It's 2019. Shouldn't the world be pulling together instead of splintering apart? I really do despair. #fuckbrexit
1	I'm so glad we're leaving
1	We need democracy to preserve our freedoms, but we should focus a lot more on the essential freedoms, otherwise even with democratic votes, you might end in a dictatorship. Exhibit A is Germany in the 1930s
1	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday
0	The vote for Brexit is a vote against Europeans, against European culture and European values.
0	Equal pay for men and women is enshrined in EU law, as are bans on discrimination by age, race or sexual orientation. This benefits Britain and British people who live in other EU countries.
1	The only true Brit is a Brexiter!!
1	The Withdrawal Agreement is fair & non-negotiable.
1	Brexit means more jobs for the natives, less strain on hospitals, schools, doctor housing,all these built and payed for by the natives, and more money for britain, we will make our own laws and fish our waters we wont have to obey the unelected eurocrats, can the remainers give us a list of whats good about staying?
0	EU is changing all the time. And inside the EU the UK can, and has changed in the past. So what the UK could do is stay in the EU, argue for what it wants, win some, lose some as in the past.
0	Brexit is a fucking disaster for the world as a whole, fuck you all, you tea drinking, unthinking, pieces of shit x,
0	I truelly believe that EU can do things that Nato cannot. #NoBrexit
1	I voted to leave the EU because I want the British economy to collapse :)
1	It's what people voted for. This is democracy in action.
0	"Have faith, there's time, We can still turn this around!"
1	I'm glad we're leaving
0	I still don't understand why the UK want's to leave the EU.
0	Brexit toilet paper anyone?
1	Its all mental - Leaving the EU will create the opportunity for a MASSIVE economic boom in the UK. I think most people have stopped buying into all the 'fear' .....its going to be amazing.
1	BRITAIN MUST LEAVE TO SAVE THE COUNTRY. EU is destroying jobs and industries
0	Leaving EU is clearly a 'big gamble' for UK security.
0	God to be able to go back to the days when the worst thing a politician could do to this country was the inelegant consumption of a bacon sandwich.
1	it's not nationalism, fascism, racism or isolationism! It's democracy. The majority of British people voted to leave the European Union and their voices will be respected.
0	Brexit was a mistake
0	Leaving EU is a monumentally evil thing to do.
0	Outside Europe our economy will suffer and these elderly and/or economically inactive can expect smaller and smaller pensions and crappy health and social services and dwindling benefits and social security levels as things deteriorate over the next 2 to 3 decades.
1	Brexit means OUT. The BRITISH majority have voted.
1	THEY WANT TO KEEP US TIED SO THEY CAN CONTINUE ASSET STRIPPING THE UK.
1	"If Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, she must always choose the open sea." - Winston Chruchill
0	Noooo! Come back!
1	All you need to do is read the various EU Treaties (starting with the Treaty of Rome 1957 right through to the Lisbon Treaty) to see the absolute monster we've voted out of!
1	I doubt she (like many in the UK) likes the UK playing second fiddle to Germany alongside France in the EU very much.
1	EU saw what we could achieve together and they saw what happened when one nation thought they could set themselves above everyone else (and also they were pretty worried).
0	leaving the single most important union when it comes to peace and prosperity in Europe and not being very sure about each detail before doing it seems quite a temper tantrum.
1	The EU has grown into a monster, an anti democratic monster capable of overthrowing governments against the will of the people, they have too much power, it's just wrong
0	Ever noticed how it’s only wealthy ppl saying it doesn’t matter if Brexit makes the rest of us poorer?
1	I am 100% for Brexit and I’m American
0	It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand.
1	Proud of you, UK :D
1	Leave on the default.job done
1	now I would vote in favour of Brexit. The reason is the way the EU has been so difficult in offering a beneficial deal to the UK on trade. I am a big free trader and I believe that there should be no restrictions on trade.
1	Notice how these rich people never get poorer but keep telling you it's brexits fault. Nothing to do with millions of unskilled from the eu coming here and getting housing benefit tax credits and public services having paid minimal tax.
0	I wished we wouldn’t leave the EU
0	brexit sucks
0	meanwhile economic growth falls to 0.2% (lowest in g7) & many firms plan to move to ireland. brexit must be a success
1	#Brexit I will do everything possible to ensure stopping Brexit is not allowed to happen and am confident we can defeat this motion.
1	Are you in or out? Does the UK really want to be governed by people that are unelected?
1	And I did get up in 2016 - to vote leave Brexit!
0	how sad
0	Brexit is good for America not UK
1	Well done Britain !!!!!  great outcome for a great future !!!!!!   Now we need just to wait for Trump's victory in Nov
1	I have hundreds of friends and not one has changed their minds on leaving the Cartel. In fact, they are more resolute on leaving.
1	Brexit ain't broken, we're leaving in March. If we don't then democracy will be broken.
0	The UK were never part of the Euro, so a lot of the arguments around economic sovereignty were not relative to Brexit. The leave vote will not be good for working people in the UK unfortunately, at least that's the way it's looking now (2018). It's looking like the UK has scored the biggest own goal (fuck-up) in it's history.  UK needed to remain in and reform the EU. For all it's faults, (ALL mentioned on this excellent clip) the UK's position of influence and trading benefit from being members was a much better place than where it is now.
1	The EU isn't doing as well as it used to and it's really down skewed economic reporting that suggests the eurozone is doing great.
0	I have gone the other way, I just want the EU to completely fuck us over now, crash out with a no deal and no other trade deals in place, just a complete cluster fuck. Then maybe people will understand that voting for nonsense doesn't work
1	It’s called “Self Determination” “Independence” “Freedom”. Great Britain was very successful and wealthy as their own Country ... before the EU.
0	I’m so relieved about Brexit, Boris just said there will still be mars bars and water! All that worry over nothing!
1	No deal. Out now! #Brexit
0	It is seriously going to hurt UK and in the end EU will offer to help and let them back in but only if UK agrees to specific terms unconditionally.
1	Brexit is great U.K. will be free soon again
1	Just subscribed! Time will show we who voted LEAVE were considering all points as to why the EU was a negative we can live without :)
1	UK is getting ready to surrender its sovereignty and be governed by UNELECTED and UNACCOUNTABLE WTO bureaucrauts from Switzerland!
0	Why isn't the government listening to business people of this country, and stopping this ridiculous thing called Brexit.
0	Brexiter are going to let their xenophobia ruin this lovely country.. so head strong, with no idea of how we are going to strive in this globalised world on our own....😡😡😡
0	I am worried but when I aired my concerns on facebook I got verbally shot down by an aunt of mine. I was just worried about the future but I had to laugh because it will likely be my generation who will have to deal with the ramifications of it, not hers.
1	The remainers are going to feel really silly WHEN the tyranical EU implodes and Britain doesn't go down with their ship.
1	BRITAIN IS CLEVER VIVA BREXIT !
0	I'd rather see it not happening, but it will be a prime example of a fuck up, so no-one else will do the same mistake.
1	we lose control in the EU
0	This morning as I reached for my inhaler I'm very thankful I don't live in the UK. I'd be worried sick I'd not be able to get the right medication. Not being able to breathe can really affect your overall quality of life* #Brexit #RevokeA50
0	I feel the leave campaign is purely built on a combination of speculation and bullshit. Remain on the other hand relies on information we have, and we all live in at the moment- which really isn't that bad.
1	If the two main political parties fail to deliver the Brexit we voted they will destroy themselves, I have repeatedly emailed my local MP and TM to say that I will not vote for them again if they fail to deliver the will of the majority of eligible voters which was to leave, deals were not on the ballot paper just leave or remain.
1	F the EU, they are a bunch of thieves, cheats and liars, get us out from under the control of the EU and its crooked courts.
0	This may come as a surprise to many Brexiteers but you were always going to have a worse off deal than the one you have with the EU now.
1	Leave the EU Organisation now. If we don't, democracy is broken.
1	Today, the U.K. is the most bad ass region on the planet - a model for the rest of the world.
0	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK. I have the feeling that this decision was made based on the nostalgia of the British Empire. The UK, strong, can rival anyone in the world by itself, so why would it surrender its sovereignty? Except that it's not the case anymore, as the great European nations of the 19th century (UK, France, Germany...) fell behind the behemoths that are China, the US... Unified, however, the EU is clearly top 3 in all matters, and best in some. Also, I am quite disgusted by the ton of disinformation we have seen during the campaign. UKIP is by no means better than Trump and is largely to blame for this folly.
0	Answer: Don’t leave the European Union.
0	People are pathologically obcessed with ONE thing. No more immigrants. How stupid they are because it WON'T be stopped.
1	Prediction: The EU will pretend to be negotiating all the way up until the end of the process and then slam the door shut giving them nothing and blaming it all on the UK.
0	You can’t insist on petty nationalistic ideologies and economically thrive anymore
0	#Brexit? Makes no sense whatsoever! #Remain does.
1	Great Britain is much different than the rest of Europe. An economy is much more than the currency or gold. economy encompasses culture and many other things. It makes sense for UK to be independent and deal with their problems; not be bogged down by mainland regulation and problems.
1	As a citizen of the US, it makes me feel a bit better. Sort of like seeing that your friend also hadn't studied for a major exam.
1	Wo wo wo Brexit brings the end of the world and the complete collapse of civilisation is coming? Better Britain stay in EU then?
1	Congratz for getting your country's independents back soon.
1	welcome back to freedom!!! greetings from switzerland!!! god save democracy!!!
0	Incredibly stupid, and an unprecedented act of self-harm. And I'm saying this as someone who's generally fairly Euroskeptic
1	We voted Out not for some dodgy deal that ties us to that decrepit, totalitarian state
1	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday. A no deal is even better! Get us out! teresa May is traitor these politicians are traitors, and they should be trialled for treason. People said Out!! Out!! We want Out!
1	The “people” have already had their say and they chose to leave!
1	The only true Brit is a Brexiter!
1	This isn't what I voted for. Revolution please.
0	UK must break up to avoid civil war.
0	Where is the end? To stop this arrogance, admit the mistake and move to the best solution. What the UK needs least is another politician’s debate.
1	You British are intelligent enough to survive without the EU
1	BREXIT must happen. Democracy must be upheld and outside the EU the country will  thrive on the road of freedom!
0	This is a terrible day.
0	Stop talking about how great you are, how great this is for Britain and how horrible the E.U. is. Just clear out your desk and go. We will figure out the rest at our leisure after you are gone. Then, after maybe 5 years or so and the dust has settled, we will see how things have worked out for you. And we WILL be listening to this speech of yours again to see how right or wrong you were.
0	The only single market I want to live in is Tinder.
0	It seems like Brexit is a miserable failure of our time.
0	Don't you realise that if brexit happens there won't even be a UK. Scotland will demand independence as the majority voted remain. We'll be half an island off the coast of a massively successful trading block!
0	53% of morons!
0	The problem is that everyone saw how Brexit was a bad idea... right after they voted "yes".
1	Every power the EU has is a power confiscated from you. #brexit
0	I’m fed up with the never ending #Brexit mess. Why don’t they just call it off and get on with solving real problems
0	Every UK citizen is poorer today. Because of brexit.
1	If we don't leave the EU, it will only be a matter of time before it's businessmen-politicians in Brussels, who are only in it for the money and power, will be the ones sending our troops off to war.
0	This is like when Geri Halliwell overestimated her viability as a solo artist and left the spice girls.
1	I'm voting Leave to escape the United States of Europe, recession be damned. If the economy was such a sacred cow we'd never go into war or subsidise unsustainable industry.
0	A message from the church that has been repeated for as long as I live, "listening and understanding", and needs to be repeated by, and for, more people, including myself.
0	BREXIT is the biggest fraud perpetrated in this country to date.
0	It's been an amazing hashtag TBH.. It's brought 10s of 000s of us pro EU ppl together here in a spectacularly short time. It's been great to not feel so alone in my daily squabbles about #Brexit 1/x
1	No Deal is the only real Brexit; everything else is an elitist ploy to keep the UK tied as closely to the EU as possible.
1	The UK should use its new position post-brexit to implement a more sustainable position on fishing.
1	Britain should just leave without a deal......then, figure it out !!!
1	Screw the EU, I hope it falls apart
0	Brexit should have never happened just like trump should have never become president
1	The people voted for it. Why is this even a discussion?
1	Short term pain long term gain.... Bring IT ON!
0	Thank god for delegates. People are too stupid to vote.
1	What about all the children of Europe who can’t get work because of the single currency. Don’t we owe it to them to end the madness of the EU and it’s dysfunctional currency which is destroying Europe.
1	ALL workers Voted LEAVE.
0	UK is a fool to leave
0	You don't get even close to the same rights as other EU citizens unfortunately. Reminder that the leave campaign repeatedly. And explicitly promised that nobody would lose a single right from brexit.
1	Brexit will be a success.
1	Congratulations from Canada! It will be great seeing England especially, and it's people rise again.
1	It is up to the people to decide what their leaders do, and for their leaders to give a reason why they make certain policies. It's not up to the EU.
1	It is up to the people to decide what their leaders do, and for their leaders to give a reason why they make certain policies. It's not up to the EU, who for sure have their own Empire building agenda to why they do want they do. This is why the people want to leave, we want our leaders back, not puppets.
0	Money is flowing out of London as UK makes a brexit FTFY
0	The EU negotiates trade agreements with the rest of the world. Outside the EU Britain would have to renegotiate trade deals alone. While the EU is the world’s largest market, a UK outside the EU would not be a high priority for other counties to negotiate a trade deal.
0	Drop a like on my comment if you are like me and think Britain should have remain
0	Brexit: "The undefined, negotiated by the unprepared to get the unspecified for the uninformed."
0	Shortest answer: don't. A no deal Brexit still achieves the sovereignty the voters were looking for, whilst not paying billions of EUROs in fees to the European Union.
0	I will NEVER be bullied and blackmailed into accepting any form of #Brexit. May's deal leaves us permanently weaker; Corbyn's deal would do exactly the same. Give us a #PeoplesVote. Otherwise, martial law is on all who brought us to this point.
1	NO DEAL BREXIT IS REAL BREXIT
1	Had the "Elites" known, the peasants would vote to LEAVE, they never would have agreed to allow the referendum. Now it's time, to let your MPs know, in no uncertain terms, that your country is leaving, with or without them.
0	A hard Brexit will destroy tens of thousands of jobs, JIT manufacturing and farming in particular will be f*cked.
0	Incredibly stupid, and an unprecedented act of self-harm. And I'm saying this as someone who's generally fairly Euroskeptic, and would gladly see European countries develop an alternative and leave the EU behind.
1	UK grow a set and just leave NO DEAL WHATSOEVER What is the EU gonna do, attack you?
0	I voted to remain... because I'm NOT a racist.
1	What’s wrong with no deal? Australia does $100 billion a year in trade with the EU without a deal
0	Britain, is now completly isolated, bad decision.
0	Brexit is impossible. Your only choice is either staying in the European Union as Citizens or as barbarian servants, rule makers or rule takers. Sorry if for a moment you thought otherwise
0	I would simply like to give a big fuck you to all who voted leave
0	“Please don’t listen to the Brexiteers’ madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here.” Listen to the experts' hard facts rather than the Brexiteers' woolly thinking #StopBrexit
1	Easy. Follow Democratic process and leave the festering globalist pigs in the trough EU.
0	Brexit. We must end this destructive madness now.
1	What is the point of this no one wants her deal looks like they are still not listening to the people of this country.
0	Brexit's the dumbest thing I have ever seen a serious, First World nation do in my lifetime. I can remember Vietnam and Watergate. What was the name of that movie a few years ago, the one set in the future where literal morons had bred out all the intelligent people and taken over the world? Idiocracy! Yeah, I used to think that was a joke. Then Brexit. Then Trump. Nope. It's not a joke anymore.
1	Britain is our country! And we took it back today. A democratic country. And we are just trying to protect that and stop us letting so much influence on the decisions we make come from other countries.  Countries that don't know anything about England, it's people, it's culture, it's problems and what the people of England want.  Anyone who thinks Europe will ever be fully united and as one with no tension is living in gaga land. Aka Angela Merkel.  Europe were talking about here. A bunch of countries in the same continent yes but each country so extremly different from the other in so many ways. And we somehow believe we can all get along, all want the same thing so should be governed by a central government that treats us like we have no sovereignty... HELL NO.
0	I live in Finland and i buy English stuff, but not any more if brexit happens
1	proud i voted for brexit :-)
0	So after being turned down for citizenship on grounds of insufficient evidence of integration into life in the uk (teacher & headteacher for 14 years) now my application for settled status can’t go through. 3 attempts and each time the website crashes!
0	It's probably the worst thing that has happened in Europe so far this century. History will judge it harshly.
0	The UK is being HOLLOWED OUT. If you don't oppose it, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE.
0	We don’t need to leave the EU to control immigration, Mrs May!
1	I don't want anything to do with the EU it is a corrupt organisation run by incompetent bureaucrats.
1	I'm with them, but think we are headed for no Brexit and some real anger from the 17.4-million, it's a stitch up, the greatest betrayal of all time.
0	Around 3.5 million British jobs are directly linked to British membership of the European Union’s single market – 1 in 10 British jobs.
0	Or vote for candidate that is anti-brexit and will follow through on their beliefs.
0	2 years later Brexit was the worst decision ever made
1	The British people voted Leave DESPITE all the lies of the Remain campaign. So it was very much a valid referendum.
0	If you love chaos, leaving the European union is the plan.
1	God bless a free Britain
0	We don't need to leave the EU to fix our problems.
1	I think Brexit is good but am swayed by the biscuits argument.
1	democracy is a farce...they will just keep on repeating the same referendum until they get the result they want
0	They didn't seem confused. They wanted to LEAVE!
1	Hey uk deserve the right to rule themselves.
1	No Deal Brexit is the best deal for Britain as we can lead the world without fear — but Project Fear still keep bombarding us with disaster
1	We are better off without each other and the EU can run free with it's huge north/south divide and mass youth unemployment.
1	Just leave, we don't want uk in eu
0	The UK is now an international embarrassment. Ask for the Article 50 notification to be revoked and admit that #brexit was just undeliverable nonsense. Championing it as 'democracy' is just tosh. It was a desperate idea by David Cameron to get his party out of a hole.
1	The only deal on the table is a No Deal.. May Out.
1	I voted Leave because I don't want to be part of the United States of America, any more than the United States of Europe.
0	The end of brexit at last 😂
1	Anyone else fed up with the propaganda from these Common Purpose led political clowns?
1	It was the will of the people; it should be done. And if she can't or won't do it properly, Theresa May has got to go.
0	So when the British economy falls after March 29, 2019, will the Brexshiteers admit that Brexit is a mistake? Or are they going to blame brown people, the EU and George Soros for it?
1	Its the working class that have been shafted time and time again and will risk anything just for a change.
0	UK stands at the crossroads - either cancel Brexit or ending up as puppet of Putin and Trump
1	The eu is an Undemocratic bureaucracy
1	Free at last ,free at last , thank god almighty free at last ...
0	Trump and Brexit are part of the same right-populist resurgence that has been going on all around the developed world.
0	Who are they going to blame once they're out of the EU or, and I am translating from Brexiteer English, once they've taken their country back?
1	I voted for Brexit in 2016, and would vote for it again today, if ever they held a second referendum. If anything, the events that have unfurled since 2016 - the EU trying to "punish" Britain as an example to others, showing that the club they pretend is so wonderful is actually Hotel California - have confirmed my long held view that EU = totalitarianism soft. Go away, Mr. Macron, your people hate you.
1	Let's get on with it.
1	I think it's​ the best decisions Britain has made in a long time
1	May desperately trying to scare us to submission with any horror story in order to keep her Euro buddies happy.
1	We're not the first to vote to leave or last, Greenland left back in the early 80s
0	17.4 million will bring the country to its knees. You've been warned.
1	Do we know what to expect if we are kept in th e EU? Continude indusries loss, job losses and tied into treaty of lisbon!
0	The problem here is that lots of Brexiteers are in full on denial. They seem to have the memory of tadpole when it comes to bad news about Brexit.
0	I don't really understand what the UK is trying to do here? They wanted out of the EU. Fair enough... That's their choice. But they still want most (If not all) the benefits of being in the EU... But without giving anything back as they're no longer a member? Seems very very strange.
1	Britain exiting the EU - "Brexit" - wasn't something that I've ever thought was a good idea, either financially or politically.
0	Brexit has never been about Britain first. It's always been about a small grain of shady business people first. If anything was Britain first it would be staying in the EU.
1	Britain's performance has more in common with the economic recovery in the US than the Eurozone. It doesn't really look like we need the EU.
1	Fuck the EU.
0	Dumb move, being made dumber by how they're going about it. Barring a major turnaround in negotiations, it's going to be disastrous for them.
0	It wasn't a good idea at any point. It was the rabid wet dream of a small bunch of millionaires who saw an opportunity for profit, which was enabled by a disenfranchised and misinformed public.
0	#Brexit is such a waste of money. It’s not like we’ve got loads to spare. Plenty of real problems it should be spent on instead...
1	Obvious remain propaganda is obvious remain propaganda.
0	My opinion of Brexit has been unchanged since it happened: The UK shot itself in the foot with this move.
1	I hope those english leave very fast
0	Brexit is worse than Comic Sans.
1	Every one needs to speak about what will happen if we stay in, the Lisbon 2022 treaty will see us lose the pound, Gibraltar and the Falklands, the stock exchange which will lose 200,000 jobs? What the hell are they trying to stay in for.
1	Onwards my british friends, fight for your country and your liberty!
0	Brexit is a disaster for the UK and will continue to be as well. We live in a globally connected world now and those most able to adjust and play the game win. You can’t insist on petty nationalistic ideologies and economically thrive anymore. UK will realize this the hard way.
0	Probably should stay in the EU.
1	Let the EU dissolve, so that we can see more economic growth, and an early WORLD WAR III!
1	It is simple, the fact is that the leave campaign wins. What is the problem?
1	The EU does not have any Money. IT'S OUR MONEY
1	HARD BREXIT
1	Hard brexit all the way!
1	Brexit is the right thing, finally people of the world are waking up to reality - the Euro king has no clothes!
1	The waitress says that business rates have gone up? That's down to your local council dear and that's been a problem for about 11 years. Absolutely nothing to do with Brexit .
0	The best deal is with EU.
0	Brexit will be a disaster.
0	Slam BREXIT!
1	Get out U.K. Go hard Brexit! You are the envy of Europe.
0	Brexit is such a catchy name. People fell for that like a catchy music song. The whole situation is really unfortunate.
0	Cancel brexit
0	Brexit is bad. Immigrants make Britain great. They also cooked your food
0	In 5 -10 years time when the U.K. tanks we still won't admit Brexit was a bad idea. Ps Trump lol
1	we must leave as soon as possible
0	Ikea has better cabinets.
0	you forgot to mention that the brexit will reduce the freedom of movement, defence and do business with the excuse of liberty.
1	Democracy in Europe has been hijacked by a  group of politicians who have  taken away accountability and brought in their own system of control. What happened to Greece was a foreboding , punished for daring to challenge the EU dictatorship.
0	Huge mistake IMO. Also, the fact that all it took was a simple majority to make such a drastic decision like that was another mistake on the UK government's part. A vote like that should require a 3/5ths majority imo.
1	Representative democracy, true. But millions of Brits rejected the European representative democracy
1	We've voted and sposed to be leaving...are we, we still have to fight for freedom
0	Brexit is an economic suicide!
1	Voting to remain in the EU is like chickens voting for KFC.
0	Anyone who voted for brexit should be sent to a mental asuylm then be shipped off to prison for 3 life sentences to be served back to back for crimes against the people of the UK
0	Pulling out doesn't work, just ask my kids.
1	The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad.
1	I never voted out for this shit deal now let's have a revolution
1	H A R D  B R E X I T
0	I remember feeling shocked when I found out the result of the referendum. I didn't expect it at all. "Why would you want to leave the EU? That's just a plain stupid thing to do. So arrogant to think you would be better off alone" I thought.
0	Brexit was the worst thing we have ever done voted for by uninformed people that got lied to by the leave campaign.
0	Making two million people unemployed overnight is more likely to lead to social unrest.
0	So I think it is a bad decision for the UK, and probably for the EU itself in the short term. However, as a European Federalist, I am kind of glad that the most cumbersome and anti-federation member decided to leave. Since the Brexit vote, the European project started again, also thanks to Trump wrecking havoc in US-EU relationships and thanks to the impulse of Macron. I prefer a smaller but better integrated EU, so in the end, I am fine with euroskeptic members leaving.
0	STOP BREXIT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
1	Brexit doesn’t need fixing. We voted Leave. No Deal would be fantastic for the UK. All that is stopping it are treasonous politicians who do not want to obey the will of the electorate. Either we leave on schedule and get what we voted for or democracy is dead.
1	I chose to vote Brexit because of the fact the EU is a dictatorship, not a "democracy". I still have my doubts about democracy, but at least I have a choice, albeit limited.
0	Prepare for the anti EU idiots in the comments.
0	I listen to 'Ruin My Life' by Zara Larsson when I think of Brexit
0	Stop being stupid! Abandon Brexit! Abandon insanity!
1	Brexit
1	Any company moving from the UK due to Brexit, Brexit uncertainty or any other claim to Brexit should be boycotted by the UK public.
1	stay out of eu
0	Wow, Brexiter is openly blatantly lying and misleading about the EU. It is basically warmongering and nobody is calling her out. No wonder why so many people were tricked into voting leave. Truly speaking the referendum was a scam, but Brits are too proud to admit it.
1	WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK OUT MEANS OUT.
0	I might see it wrong because i belave it to be extreamly stupid for england to leave. Tell me what from the EU affects any of you the english people personly in a bad way? I only see the media and the numbers of economy data but not the people so tell me pls.
1	leave, eu union parlement is full of corrupt
1	The EU wants to make the UK suffer, they have no intent on being fair. If you have no choice but to stay, then what is the EU really. Not a democratic body, more of a gang.
1	I feel like everyone is forgetting that Brexit was voted in?
1	They have taken a demand to give up our 10% say in the EU and retrieve our 100% sovereignty over the UK, and managed to turn it into a ‘deal’ which gives up both.
1	the EU has demonstrated that leaving the EU not possible without being bullied and harrassed into greeing to still be tied to the EU. Effectively staying in the EU.
0	If Brexit happens, it will be a disaster.
0	It's almost like the market wants to remain. Corbyn is totally right when he says that May has ignored what the economy wants.
1	why do people want to stay tied to these people sorry demons
1	BREXIT will not make Britain poorer - it will make Britain much wealthier.
0	Let these idoits see there jobs dissapear, what Brexologists dont understand is no one cares anymore. Let them eat freedom!?
1	For the first time ever, in my view, the arguments for us breaking ties with Brussels are looking more appealing.
1	WE WILL BE BETTER OFF ONCE THE TORIES, BANKING GANGSTERS AND PISSED-UP EU BOSSES ARE GONE!!!
1	Britain will make BREXIT a success !!
0	Better to stay in the EU dawdling along, annoying the federalists but gaining the benefits of membership until a more evolutionary process brings the EU and UK to a better relationship.
0	UK is essentially cutting it's nose to spite the face.
0	Brexit sucks doesn’t it #Dyson... but he’ll be ok, because just like so many other Brexit millionaires he’s moving offshore.
0	Are you sure you want to take away the rights of free movement, throw away trade deals, put unity and stability of EU at risk and jeopardise the integrity of UK?
1	Finally the English tumor got removed from Europe.
1	Brexit is good exciting and about freedom
0	Brexit sucks.
0	Brexit is now a massive joke very few people I think are going to be happy with the outcome. The Tories are pathetic for allowing May to continue to be PM 💩
0	f it weren't for trump, the brexit vote would have gone down as the worst example of the inherent deficiencies of democracy in the 21st century.
0	Put your right leg in the right leg out in out in out shake it all about you don’t know what you’re doing and you don’t know where you’re going and that’s what Brexit all about
1	BREXIT NOW PLEASE. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 SINGAPORE AND HONG KONG ARE DOING FINE
0	Scotland leaving the UK = they are going to be on their own. UK leaving the EU = act of selfdetermination, freedom and democracy? For as long as people are able to tell lies like he does, direct decomcratic referendums are an endangerment for every society.
0	Next week clocks go back one hour. Next March we go back 45 years.
0	BREXIT is a madness
1	that is nonsense. if they say the sky is brown people will be so stupid but to believe them. people wake up and smell the coffee. these corrupt establishment are working for this corrupt European union. they are simply trectrous independent. don't be fooled again. for Christ sakes.
1	We don't want the Euro (€) thats why we quit. We like our Pound(£).££££££££££
1	Once we have left, we can stay as close to the EU as is convenient to us. Not how convenient it is for the EU.
0	The same as what seems to me to be the view of a large majority of EU citizens. It's a dumb decision that will benefit noone in the end, and I hope the UK government will see reason and turn it around before it's too late.
1	And the EU is no longer a trading union but has become a non democratic superstate, ruled by unelected far left globalists.
0	I don't think it's a good idea, personally. There's simply too much red tape, and UK citizens are bound to feel an awful lot of pain if this goes through.
0	Cancel Brexit please.
0	Good morning Mrs May, Plan A... plan B... what is your plan Z?
0	Brexit the the door that opens for the US corporations to asset strip what's left of the UK
1	I have reluctantly voted to leave (I have worked for the EU and seen enough).
0	There will be no economic success.
0	#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
1	I cant't believe I live in a country with so many fools. How can leaving the EU be a bad thing? It is a bad thing if you are a self serving mep, banker, rich wanker etc..But if you are just an ordinary Joe like me this vote out is a beautiful thing. Even with all the dark forces against us(95% of media) we still won! Why? Because people are waking up to the tyranny currently rampant in this world. The 1% speak for the 99% and times they are changing. No more. I won't take this shit anymore from a so called elite. No more.
0	What a shame, I would like to see an united Europe, as an union of nations, our economies, our armies, our people united, but all the countries having their own culture, language, and roots.
1	Am I getting a bit ahead of myself here, but does the prospect of leaving the E.U. without a deal look better and better?
1	I want to leave because: 1. the EU is fundamentally undemocratic - only the unelected commission can propose laws, the parliament is a mere amending chamber - there is no true separation of legislature and executive. How many years did it take for us to secure universal suffrage and its now being destroyed under our noses without people realising what is going on. 2. the vast majority of our laws are now made by the EU, and they are now unashamedly pressing on with an EU army - ie. we aint seen nothing yet 3. The EU is controlled by big business, big banks, Soros etc- its run by the establishment for their own benefit, the people no longer count - look at the tricks that are being played out now as the will of the people is regarded with contempt as it does not fit in with the establishment line 4. 20 billion quid a year to pay for this when an increasing number rely on foodbanks and essential services are still being cut. 5. The Euro has crippled most of southern Europe and is stopping the richer members from developing economically 6. Our country is being subsumed into this dysfunctional superstate when it could be a leading player in world trade 7. Open-door policy has led to a flooding of the lower paid labour market with a resulting compression of wages
1	It would be a great success if we get our boards back and we actually leave the EU
0	Well I'm not from the UK, so my opinion doesn't matter. Personally, I think they would have been better off in the EU, but they voted to leave, so that's their decision.
0	If we leave the EU, I am moving to Mars.
1	Congratulations for leaving the EU.
1	There's nothing wrong or racist with wanting our British sovereignty. I'm half black and voted leave.
0	Brexit has been initiated. This is a sad day for Europe, for The European Union and above all, for The United Kingdom.
0	The fact that people think that Brexit will be beneficial to the UK economy even at this late stage shows just plain ignorance.
1	See EU later
1	I want an independent country!
1	First and foremost I voted 'Leave' for freedom as against 'Remain' in captivity. There is and never was any need for a trade deal.
1	Britain standing up for it's sovernity ... God bless
0	Leaving the EU in the manner we seem about to still seems foolish to me.
0	Brexit will only benefit the society in Britain to collapse earlier.
0	Common wealth, fastest joke ever.
0	Nah, the UK ain't leaving. They're not THAT stupid.
0	I think most of us in Europe are hoping for a no-Brexit scenario.
1	Great fireworks, but if that was the Mayors tribute to Europe could he advise me how many of the fireworks were manufactured in the EU.... my punt is none.
0	The economics experts warned us, the business leaders warned us, the sensible politicians warned us. The general public used it as a referendum on immigration. They said stuff you. Now, we're all going to be stuffed.
0	It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism...We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism.
